This is a command-line option parsing library for Scheme. It is
currently a work-in-progress, and quite rough.

Suggestions are appreciated.

## Goals

* Prefer portable (R[67]RS) Scheme.

* Support a reasonable subset of the option styles that GNU getopt
  and Haskellâ€™s optparse-applicative can handle.

* Provide a nice high-level macro language for describing command
  line syntax.

* Keep it simple, stupid.
